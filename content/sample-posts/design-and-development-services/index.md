## Experience Design

Experience is everything. Whatever your product, service or cause, your goal is to convince those who experience your digital marketing to want to take action and experience the real thing. For a restaurant, this means beautiful images and video that make your visitors’ mouth water. If you’re a destination location, it means designing an experience that shows just how great it will be to visit.

We prioritize simplicity in user experience over everything and our philosophy of small iterative cycles includes frequent user testing to ensure that everyone can find the information and experience they need with little to no friction.

Furthermore, data from work such as our Journey workshop and the above user testing leads us to build personalized experiences where appropriate to get just the right experience to each visitor exactly when they need it.

## Development Services

Software should be simple to use and easy to maintain. At Daybreak Studio we believe less is more and will always strive to use existing products and software before taking on engineering efforts. Sometimes engineering efforts are necessary, more efficient or save significant costs. If that’s the case, we use the most modern techniques possible such as the JAM Stack for web development, and serverless architectures for APIs. This leads to lower costs, greater scale and security, and even faster development. Using these technologies and taking a light weight, agile approach to project management, mean that the old rule of choosing 2 between quality, low cost and speed need not apply here.
