## What We Do:
Daybreak Studio helps organizations reach people through better use of technology. The world of marketing, advertising and customer service technology is vast and daunting, but the goal behind it all is simply to scale your teamâ€™s ability to find the right people and communicate the most relevant message. Daybreak Studio helps organizations navigate this challenge through workshops, design and development services, and ongoing data driven insights and recommendations.

## Philosophy:
Every day is a new day. Just like the cycle of a day is short, we believe in rapid iteration and agile development and services. Our mission is to offer short, high impact offerings focussed on sending a jolt of energy and new ideas into your organization to drive rapid results. Even if you have a large development project, our goal will always be to take in small, manageable chunks with the ability to measure and change course along the way. This methodology leads to better results and lower cost.

## Team:
Daybreak Studio is a husband and wife team: Dave and Amy Ingram. To stay nimble, we bring on additional resources as the project demands to augment design and development services.
