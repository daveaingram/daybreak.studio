If you have a sense that your marketing efforts are less effective than they could be, it likely comes down to an intuitive sense that you should be doing more to speak to individual customers better based on their context. To do this, it’s essential to understand your customer’s personas and the journeys that they’re on. From there, you need to implement technology to scale your communications with those individuals in a way that is efficient with your team’s time while still maintaining a feeling of authenticity with your customers.

The Customer Journey workshop involves capturing the voice of your customers through your team’s insights, quantitative interviews and surveys, and qualitative data analytics. We will build out a series of maps depicting the current journey your customers or prospective customers are going down, and then an idealized map of how different buyer personas will interact with your brand.

These resources serve as a basis for future content creation, implementation of new and existing technologies, and a rallying point for your organization to set more precise goals.
