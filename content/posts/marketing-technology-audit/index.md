Do you have a clear picture as to how all of your internal systems affect your customers’ experience? Do you have a feeling you’re missing opportunities to capture data or engage in more relevant ways? A technology audit helps to answer these questions and more by performing a comprehensive evaluation of your organization’s digital presence and the systems that power it.

The output of this workshop is a series of diagrams and documentation which captures the current state of your technology stack, and a series of recommendations for possible improvements. When appropriate, the workshop will wrap up with the installation and configuration of free analytics and optimization tools such as Google Analytics and Google Optimize to fill in data blind spots and pave the way for future optimizations.
